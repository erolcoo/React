# React + Vite
# Trip Organization Platform

This is a web application for excursions where any user can choose from the catalog of excursions. However, to get an offer, they must have an account. Users with an account can create their own travel destinations, as well as edit and delete them. Firebase is used for the backend, and the application is developed with React and Vite.

## Key Features

- **Browse Offers:** Users can browse existing trip offers.
- **Create Trip Offers:** Logged-in users can create their own trip offers.
- **Authentication:** Firebase is used to manage user accounts and security.

## Technologies

- **React:** Used for building the user interface.
- **Vite:** Provides fast and efficient development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- **Firebase:** Used for backend services, including authentication and database.
- **ESLint:** Ensures code quality.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
